### AWS - Infrastructure as a service - Basics
- its a collection of cloud services
- ex: 
	- EC2 - compute(rented machine)
	- ECR - container repository
	- devtools - codecommit, codepipeline
	- DBs - DynamoDB
	- ..etc.

### IAM - Identity and Access management
- manage access to aws services
- when you create account initially, we will have a root user
- better create an admin user, with less priviliges
- system user: apart from real human users. ex: jenkins
- components of IAM
	- Users
	- Roles
	- Groups
	- Identity providers
	- Customer managed policies
- flow
	- add user to group
	- assign policies to group
	- follow east priviliged access

### Regions
- physical locations where data is stored
- usually they are replicated, just in case
- choose region near to your customers

### VPC, virtual private network
- it is your own isolated network in the cloud
- this private network is isolated from others
- VPC can have multiple availability zones/subnets
- any instance you starts runs in a vpc
- private subnet: external traffic is closed(all ports are closed)
- public subnet: allowed external traffic (internet gateway)
- best practice is to have a  service which will be in public subnet and they in turn talk with private subnet
- CIDR is used to divide subnets

### EC2 - Elastic Computer Cloud
- Virtual server in AWS cloud
- provides compute capacity
- just like a computer on cloud
- flow
	- launch instance
	- choose os
	- choose instance type(storage, memory etc.)
	- network config 
		- choose vpc
		- chose subnet
- add storage
- add tags (misc info)
- configure security group(firewall)
	- each subnet can have different firewall rules
- download private key pem file for ssh access
```
ssh -i pem_file_location ec2-user@instance-ip 
```

### aws cli
- all services from aws are also supported via aws cli
-
