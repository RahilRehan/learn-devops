### SDLC
- Plan
- Implement
- Test
- Deploy
- Maintain

### developers vs operations
- developers code and test the application or new features
- when the app or feature becomes releasable
- they hand it over to operations team

- operation teams deploy the app into production
- also makes sure that there is no downtime introducing the new feature
- handle huge traffic/load by making sure underlying infra is good

- as two roles are very different in their job, there is always a communication gap
- devops is an intermediary introduced between developers and operations team to make the transision from development to operations

### agile model
- plan, implement, deploy, feedback, fix, deploy
- introduction of CI/CD (Continous Integration/Continous Delivery)
