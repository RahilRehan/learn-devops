# My journey of learning devops
In this repo I'm documenting all the things which I'm learning throughout this journey.

## Target
- My target is to learn devops in 100 daysðŸ˜…, well atleast get a gist of it.
- I'm going to follow a breadth first approach to learn devops as I don't want to spend too much time learning internals of each and every technology.
